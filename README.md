# Grails
Grails version 4.0.1
JVM java version 1.8.0_312
Everything is build and configure in a directory using "grails create-app com.djamware.grailsproject"
Mainly configured build.gradle by switching out the database and replace it a MongoDB database, adding grails spring security core plugin.
Also configured grails-app/conf/appllication.yml, making a connection for MongoDB and commentting out Hibernate and H2 database connection from the yml.
